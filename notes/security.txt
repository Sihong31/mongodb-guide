Security Checklist

-Authentication & Authorization
-Transport Encryption:
    Data in transit should be encrypted
-Encryption at Rest:
    Data in the database should be encrypted
-Auditing:
    Pure server admin task
    Who did what? What actions occured
-Server & Network config and setup
-Backups & Software Updates


Authentication:
    -Identifies valid users of the database
    -Analogy: You are employed and therefore may access the office
Authorization:
    -Identifies what these users may actually do in the database
    -Analogy: You are employed as an account and therefore may access the office and process orders

Users are assigned Roles
Roles contains Privileges
Privileges are made up of Resources and Actions
Resource, for example, Shop Database => Products Collection
Action, for example, insert()

Why Roles?
    Different types of Database Users
    Administrator, Developer, Data Scientist
    Administrator => Manages database configs, create users, does not need to fetch or insert data
    Developer => Needs to be able to perform CRUD operations, does not manage database configs or create users
    Data Scientist => Needs to be able to fetch data, does not manage database configs or create users


Two ways to authenticate in mongo shell
db.auth("user", "password")
mongo -u <user> -p <password>
mongo -u <user> -p <password> --authenticationDatabase admin

use admin
// can createUser() on specific databases, this offers a lot of flexibility
db.createUser({user: "test", pwd: "test", roles: ["userAdminAnyDatabase"]})
// updateUser will replace old roles, can also set which database the user should have roles in
db.updateUser("test", {roles: ["readWrite", {role: "readWrite", db: "blog"}]})
db.auth("test", "test")
// result success => 1
